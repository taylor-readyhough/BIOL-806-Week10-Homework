Research Interests: carnivore ecology, urban ecology, quantitative ecology, animal behavior
My PhD project will focus on how competing carnivores share habitat fragments in an urban area, specifically in the Cleveland Metroparks 
system.

This is now Lily, your collaborator who is also interested in similar topics.
Maybe we can join the same lab and work together.
